               <p><i>"Remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians, and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes."</i> 
               <br>-- President Obama, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university">23 May 2013</a></p>
               <p>But what happens <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/drones-silent-killers-64909">when we're wrong</a>? This map examines locations in Pakistan that reported civilian and children deaths from drone strikes. Among the locations here,</p>
               <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Norak, Pakistan (2011)</b><br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total casualties (minimum reported): 2<br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Civilian casualties (minimum reported): 2<br>
               &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Children casualties (minimum reported): 2.</p>
               <p>While the figures on hand are estimates --- being that there remain wide gaps between what the U.S. government claims and what nongovernmental parties assert  --- the data is no less frightening to contemplate. From above, it appears that children were the sole victims of a 2011 CIA drone strike.</p>
               <p>The last child victim to a drone strike was in 2012 in Hamzoni, according to what the <a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com">London Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> has made available. The marked locations are scaled by the number of total casualties. Click on the markers to get more information.</p> 
               <p>Information was collected from a BIJ article, <a href="http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/05/23/get-the-data-what-the-drones-strike/">"Get the data: What the drones strike"</a>. BIJ has reported extensively on U.S. drone strikes: <a href="http://wherethedronesstrike.com">Where the Drones Strike</a>.</p>
