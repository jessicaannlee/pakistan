ABOUT THIS PROJECT
========

A look at civilian and children casualties, based on data from the London Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The spreadsheet was downloaded as you see it in the ".../data/pakistan.csv" above from http://bit.ly/1CGrbCt (29 September 2014), from BIJ's article http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/05/23/get-the-data-what-the-drones-strike/. BIJ has much more in-depth reporting at http://wherethedronesstrike.com, a collaboration between BIJ, Forensic Architecture, and SITU Research.

Details of my analysis: Scales of the markers were determined by ([total casualties]*1000)/2, for illustrative purposes. Opacity of the markers was determined by [child casualties]/[total casualties]. Note that because there is such a wide discrepancy between "official" government and nongovernmental reports, it is "impossible to know" the exact number of civilians (and children) who have been killed by U.S. drone strikes. For more information, I suggest reading: http://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-so-far-about-drone-strikes.
